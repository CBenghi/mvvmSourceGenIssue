# mvvmSourceGenIssue
A repository to help repro an issue I am experiencing with source generation under the brilliant mmvm toolkit.

## Notes

I'm not sure if this is a code generation or VS issue, since I'm also experiencing 
[a known issue](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Feature-codelens-references-is-currently/1364256) 
with this minimal implementation.
